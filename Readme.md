# How to use

### Extract
1. Go to ```emoji-extract-from-font```
2. ```npm install```
3. ```node index.js```

The script will then extract the emoji from the apple font file (Apple Color Emoji.ttf) and save them in different sizes in a subfolder called images.

### Update Android Resources
1. Go to ```emoji-update-resources```
2. ```go run main.go -src=<src path generated by the script above> -dst=<the absolute path you want to copy them to>```

This script will match the existing emoji to the extracted files and only update those.
